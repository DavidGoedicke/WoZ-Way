The automobile is a great example of these challenges, where on-road testing is time-consuming and provides little ability for rapid prototyping of interface behavior. In this demonstration, we show WoZ Way, a system to connect remote designers and researchers. This code provides the computing systems to give people the opportunity to \"ride along\" with a driver on the road while observing the drive, interacting through a machine speech system, viewing live car data, and controlling an in-car interface prototype.\r\n\r\n### System Description\r\n1. A Wizard interface with live video, audio, and data displays from the remote vehicle and controls to send text-to-speech messages to the driver or control the behavior of in-car prototypes\r\n1. A mediating data server to manage communication between the remote vehicle and the Wizard interface; the data server also collects time-stamped data logs\r\n1. A computer in the car to collect and share video, audio, and automotive data over the internet with the Wizard interface and to control spoken text-to-speech messages, screen interfaces, and electromechanical components\r\n1. Auxiliary interfaces including screens, sensors, and actuators used in each specific study\r\n\r\n### Suggested Citation\r\nIf you use any part of this code for your own research, please cite:\r\n\r\nNikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju. 2017.
